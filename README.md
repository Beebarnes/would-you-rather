# Would you Rather?

This application was developed for the Udacity React Nanodegree to exhibit compentency in using React with Redux. Users can view all the questions, select a single question to view, answer the questions, create new questions, and view the leaderboard. Users, questions, and the authedUser are saved on the store, which is represented by _DATA.js. 

## Installing would you rather

Cloning this repository means that the user needs to only `cd` in to the correct directory and run <code>npm install</code> followed by <code>npm start</code>. This will open the web page for the application.

## Notes on Use

Currently no adding user support exists. 3 allowable users have been provided and choosing one will be required to reach any other part of the application. Future changes may involve adding user support and dressing up the application.
